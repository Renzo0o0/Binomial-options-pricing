This repository implements a binomial options pricing model as a clean, educational introduction to derivatives valuation  the conceptual foundation that precedes the Black–Scholes model.

The project is written in Python, highly commented, and structured so that any student or junior quant can follow the logic behind:

risk-neutral probabilities

price tree construction

European option payoffs

backward induction

discounting under the risk-neutral measure

visual representation of the price tree

This mini–project is a direct stepping stone toward Black–Scholes, Greeks, and implied volatility, and forms part of a progressive learning path in quantitative finance.
